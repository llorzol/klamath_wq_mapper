# Klamath Water-Quality Mapper

This map interface represents continuous and discrete water-quality data collected by Bureau of Reclamation and USGS at Klamath Basin sites.
The USGS and Reclamation data stored in NWIS are accessible using existing
  tools such as <a href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/or/nwis/"
                   target="_blank">NWIS-Web</a> and the
  <a href="https://or.water.usgs.gov/grapher/" target="_blank">USGS Data
  Grapher</a> system. Although these tools are useful, the NWIS-Web
  interface is still evolving and improving. A
  <a href="https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/index.html"
           target="_blank">map-based interface to NWIS</a> is available
  and useful, but that interface does not provide any new functionality to
  quickly view and explore datasets. This map interface tool allows a
  spatial filtering of sites based on the parameter measured so that the
  user can quickly focus on a point of interest and examine it further.
  
  Users are cautioned to consider the nature of the information
  presented here before making decisions using it that concern personal
  or public safety or the conduct of business that involves substantial
  monetary or operational consequences.  Some data are provisional and
  may be subject to revision.
